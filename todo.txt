1. MAKE SURE memory is handled how I want it to be handled 
    - update override equality signs to pass references and not just copy
    - check all of the overridden operators
        - for both vector and tensor2d
2. watch a video on pointers
3. CHECK vector addition on a  using +=
    - does not seem to actually update, rather it makes a copy
