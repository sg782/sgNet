1. MAKE SURE memory is handled how I want it to be handled 
    - update override equality signs to pass references and not just copy
    - check all of the overridden operators
        - for both vector and tensor2d
2. watch a video on pointers
3. update function declarations to include 'const' where applicable.
4. update and add more error/ bounds messages
5. update vector default constructor or whatever to let me declare a vector then set it to something later without resizing
6. VECTOR and TENSOR: add a shape() method that returns the shape
7. add a rowwise and colwise maximum
    - maybe rowwise and colwise tensors will have to become their own class
        - or could just add colMax and rowMax functions
8. add norm
9. vector change it to array operations maybe idk. it doesnt need to be resizable
10. standardize the API for all the layers


unrelated but i should make a voxel renderer
