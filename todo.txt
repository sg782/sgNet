1. MAKE SURE memory is handled how I want it to be handled 
    - update override equality signs to pass references and not just copy
    - check all of the overridden operators
        - for both vector and tensor2d
2. watch a video on pointers
3. update function declarations to include 'const' where applicable.
4. update and add more error/ bounds messages
5. update vector default constructor or whatever to let me declare a vector then set it to something later without resizing
6. VECTOR and TENSOR: add a shape() method that returns the shape
