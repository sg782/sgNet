C++ debuggin notes

I am new to c++ so imma write some notes down


1. MAKE SURE your class has a default constructor if you decide to declare it but not instantiate.
2. check to see if a similar constant defined method is required
3. make sure methods are defined as public if you want to use thems
4. if vectors/tensors are giving weird results, make sure that you (ME) did not for get to fix things after copy pasting
5. if you are getting an odd warning using a friend operator that states that the definition isnt defined in hte namespace,
    just implement the friend function in the relevant header file, rather than declaring it and implementing in the .cpp file
        - idk why. sometimes having the definition and implementation in separate files is ok. I assume it is some user error
