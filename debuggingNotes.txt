C++ debuggin notes

I am new to c++ so imma write some notes down


1. MAKE SURE your class has a default constructor if you decide to declare it but not instantiate.
2. check to see if a similar constant defined method is required
3. make sure methods are defined as public if you want to use thems
4. if vectors/tensors are giving weird results, make sure that you (ME) did not for get to fix things after copy pasting
